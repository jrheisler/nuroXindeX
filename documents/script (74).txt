LIGHTS:
AFTER SOUND ENDS  ADD SPOT ON THE FRONT STAGE^

DIRECTION:
Barbara and Johnny are seated at the Front Door stage, with the spot on them.^

BARBARA:
They ought to make the day the time changes the first day of summer. Then two good things would happen all at once.^

JOHN:
(A little laugh from the man as he straightens his tie.)^

BARBARA:
I love the long days and the extra sun.^

JOHN:
A lot of good the extra daylight does me. i lost an hour's sleep. And it's dark already, and we still have a three-hour drive, and we won't get back till after midnight.^

BARBARA:
(Barbara reaches down to put her shoes on.) If it really dragged you that much, you wouldn't do it.^

JOHN:
Are you kidding? I certainly don't want to blow sunday on this scene. We're gonna either have to move mother to Parkville or move the grave to pittsburgh.^

BARBARA:
Oh, you're just being silly. Mother can't make a drive like this.^

DIRECTION:
John reaches to the back seat and produces a flowered, cross-shaped grave ornament. In the center of the cross, in gold script on a red field, is written "We Still Remember"^

JOHN:
Look, twenty-five dollars ... "We Still Remember... I don't, you know it ... I don't remember what the guy looks like.^

BARBARA:
Johnny ... it takes you five minutes.^

JOHN:
Three hours... no, six hours   six hours and five minutes.^

DIRECTION:
Barbara continues to primp and straighten her outfit. John hands her the grave ornament and leans forward to struggle into his suit jacket.^

JOHN:
Mother wants to remember. So we have to drive four-hundred miles to plant a cross on a grave, as if he's staring up through the ground to check out the decorations   (he points at the cross inscription) ... we have to remember ... and she stays at home.^

BARBARA:
Johnny, we're here ... all right?^

LIGHTS:
SPOT FOLLOW JOHN AND BARBARA^

DIRECTION:
She opens her door and turns to step out. John takes the keys from the ignition and drops them into his pocket.^

JOHN:
Hey ... hey, Barb, you know the radio's been on all this time^

SFX:
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)...Ladies and gentlemen ... please forgive ... what ... hey, you got a signal, Charlie?^VO1.mp3

JOHN:
It must have been the station.^

SFX:
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)... do not be all^VO2.mp3

JOHN:
Hey, the radio is okay, it's just^

DIRECTION:
Barbara is more interested in finding the row containing their father's grave. Walks though the room^

BARBARA:
You remember which row its in?^

JOHN:
(Momentarily forgetting the radio) Huh? Oh, it's over here, I think^

DIRECTION:
They start in his suggested direction. Pull the chairs after the spot leaves the front of the stage^

JOHN:
Did you hear the radio?^

BARBARA:
(Looking ahead, trying to spot the grave) Hmmm?^

JOHN:
The radio's fixed. Must've been the station, not the radio.^

BARBARA:
(Still searching intently, she tosses this Line away) Good ... you won't be as bitchy driving home.^

DIRECTION:
Their jibes at each other are not really in anger, but are typical of brother-sister annoyance. They walk through the row of gravestones in the growing darkness.^

JOHN:
(Making conversation, with no more Significance than a comment about the weather) Nobody around.^

BARBARA:
Well, it is late. If you'd get up a little earlier^

JOHN:
I already lost an hour's sleep on the time change.^

BARBARA:
Oh, sometimes I think you complain just to hear yourself talk.^

JOHN:
An hour earlier and it'd still be light. (He squints into the dusk) It's hard enough to find in the light.^

BARBARA:
There it is. (She points)^

DIRECTION:
They move toward a grave with a standard rectangular stone. It is an unkept grave, its outline cropped and overgrown with grass and wilted flowers. John takes the flowered cross and, stepping close to the headstone, embeds its wire-prong base into the earth, as he rambles on.^

JOHN:
Wonder what happened to the one from last year? Every year twenty-five bucks for one of these things, and the one from last year is gone....^

BARBARA:
The flowers die.... and the caretaker or somebody takes them away...^

JOHN:
(Standing, brushing himself off) Yeah, a little spit and polish and they can sell them again. I wonder how many times we've bought the same^

ZOMBIE:
In the distance, a huddled figure is walking among the graves. ENTER ZOMBIE #1^

JOHN:
(Glancing at his watch) C'mon, Barb, church was this morning^

DIRECTION:
The girl continues her prayers. John lights a cigarette, idly exhales the first puff of smoke and looks around again. The huddled figure still moves slowly among the graves. John turns to his sister and is about to say something but sees her making the sign of the cross and dropping her beads in her purse. She turns from the grave and they both start to walk slowly away.^

JOHN:
(Slightly uncomfortable about urging her to leave) Well ... I mean ... prayin's for church.^

BARBARA:
I haven't seen you in church lately.^

JOHN:
Well, grandpa told me I was damned to hell ... (He says this lightly, looking ahead to a large tree. He smiles.) You remember? Right here... I jumped out at you from behind that tree ... Grandpa got all excited ... "You will be damned ta hell"^

JOHN:
Right here, I jumped out from behind that tree at you.^

JOHN:
You used to be so scared here.^

BARBARA:
Johneee! (With forced irritation)^

JOHN:
(Laughing, playfully) You're still afraid^

BARBARA:
Stop it... I mean it^

JOHN:
(Mockingly) ...They're gonna get you, Barbara^

BARBARA:
Stop it.. You're ignorant^

JOHN:
They're coming for you, Barbara .... They're gonna get you... (He leers at her, as though he is about to pounce).^

BARBARA:
(Becoming a little nervous) Johnny, stop...^

JOHN:
(Mockingly ominous) They're coming out of their graves ... after you... they're coming... to get you^

ZOMBIE:
ZOMBIE #1^

DIRECTION:
With this, John throws up his arms and his voice rises. The ZOMBIE #1 moving among the graves stops, and stands for a moment. Barbara glances toward ZOMBIE #1 and momentarily her anxiety turns to embarrassment.^

BARBARA:
(As we cut back to her) You're acting like an idiot.^

DIRECTION:
John speaks in a low tone now, glancing at ZOMBIE #1 as they draw closer in their perpendicular paths. John's remarks now are directed to Barbara, as though he didn't want ZOMBIE #1 TO HEAR^

JOHN:
Here comes one of them now^

BARBARA:
(Walking faster) He'll hear you^

JOHN:
Coming to get you^

DIRECTION:
BOTH ARE STANDING ON THE APRON OF THE STAGE ZOMBIE #1 APPROACHES^

John 21 SECONDS^Johnnie.mp3

DIRECTION:
Embarrassed, she cuts herself short and continues to walk, more rapidly now. Down the stairs, beyond the intersection of ZOMBIE #1. John stops, laughing, and turns to look back at his sister. She is near the place where the paths meet, and so is the ZOMBIE #1. She makes her way back to the steps on the front of the stage. She is looking down in embarrassed silence, aware of her proximity with the ZOMBIE. She feigns poise, and as she makes the intersection looks up nervously to deliver a socially necessary smile to the old mourner...  The ZOMBIE lunges at Barbara. A frightened gasp chokes her. She is coughing. The ZOMBIE grips her arm and slashes at her clothing. She flails about choking trying to yell....^

JOHN:
(Horrified) Hey... god^

DIRECTION:
The ZOMBIE is all over Barbara, unable to hold her in her violent flailing.  He seems to be trying to bite her arm.  John leaps at the man. The three fall to STAGE APRON, Barbara kicking, and beating with her purse. John gets a firm hold on the man and Barbara is able to wrench free. The ZOMBIE is thrashing wildly at all parts of John's body. They struggle to their feet, the figure thrashes, beats, tears like an animal... John clutches at him and they fall in a heap. In the darkness, their form is as one thrashing thing.  Barbara screams wildly. JOHN LYING ON THE STAGE, BARBARA RUNS TO THE FRONT DOOR STAGE, SPOT AREA/CAR^

There, by god ... this ought to hold them... It ain't gonna be too long, they be tryin' to hammer their way in here. they're afraid now. They're scared of fire too, I found that out There must've been fifty ... a hundred of 'em down in Crestline when the news broke ... . I seen this big gasoline truck, you know ... down Goodwin's ...Goodwin's grocery...  This gas truck come screamin' outta the grocery lot onto the road ... must be ten fifteen of them things chasin' it ... and it looks funny to me, but I don't see the things runnin' behind it right away. I just see this big truck ... and it looks funny, you know, how slow trucks'll start ... and it's pullin' out onto the road ... and weavin' ... then I see them things ... and the truck's movin' so slow, they're catchin' up ... and grabbin' ... jumpin' on^

BEN:
And that truck just cut right 'cross the road ... at the stop sign... through the guard rail and the big sign on the corner, you know. I'm startin' to throw on my brakes, and the truck smashes into the pumps in the gas station down there ... I hear this crash ... and that big thing starts burnin' ... and it's still movin' ... right through the pump stand and on into the station ... and I'm stopped, stock still ... and I see them things ... and they all startin' to back off ... Some of em runnin' ... or at least it looks like they're runnin', but they move right... and they keep backin off ... and it's like ... it's like they gotta get away from the fires ... And the guy drivin' the truck can't get out no how ... he got the cab of the truck plowed halfway into the wall of the station ... that thing's fryin' him in there and he's screamin' ... screamin' like hell^

I don't know what's gonna happen, you know? I mean ... I don't know if the whole place gonna explode ... or fly to pieces   or what's gonna happen ... I start drivin' for the gas station ... and the cat in the truck is screamin' and screamin' ... and after a while he just stops ... And there's them things standin' back ... 'cross the road ... standin' lookin' like ... lookin like ... like they just come back from the grave or somethin' ... and they're over by the grocery ... and there's cars and busses in the grocer's lot, and lots of windows is smashed. And it's for sure them things done the people in the grocery in ... and more is outside, all over the place, just bidin' their time for a chance to move in. so I start my truck up, and I barrel it right at some of them things ... I'm steamin' down right on 'em and I get a good look at 'em ... I see them for the first time in my lights ... and I say to myself, I've got a family, I've got kids, and a wife, they're not getting me. I'm getting to my family! I just run right down on 'em ...  down hard as I can ... and I knock a couple of 'em about fifty feet, flailin' into the air ... and I just want to smash them ... crush them filthy things. And they're just standin' there. They ain't runnin', they ain't even tryin' to get outta the road. some of em is even reachin' out, as if they can grab me. But they're just standin' there, and my truck is runnin' them down ...like they was bugs or something'^

DIRECTION:
Ben stands staring at the two new men. He exudes an air of resentment, as though the strangers have intruded on his private little fortress.^

BEN:
..Why ... Man, I ...^

TOM:
Looks like you got things pretty well locked in.^

BEN:
Man, I could've used some help. How long you guys been in there?^

HARRY:
That's the cellar ... . It's the safest place.^

BEN:
Man, you mean you didn't hear the racket we were makin' up here?^

HARRY:
How were we supposed to know what was going on up here? It could have been those things, for all we know.^

BEN:
That girl was screamin'. Now, you know what a girl sounds like. Them things don't make no noise. Anybody's got to know there's somebody up here could use some help.^

TOM:
You can't really tell what's goin' on from down there^

HARRY:
We thought we could hear screams, but that might have meant  Those things were in the house after her.^

BEN:
And you wouldn't come up 'n help?^

TOM:
(A little ashamed) ... Well, I.. if ... there was more of us^

HARRY:
That racket sounded like the place was being ripped apart ... How were we supposed^

BEN:
You just said it was hard to hear down there. Now you say it sounded like the place was being ripped apart. You better get your story straight, mister ...^

HARRY:
All right! Now you tell me. I'm not going to take those kind of chances when we got a safe place ... We luck into a safe place, and you're tellin' us to risk our lives just because somebody needs help ... .^

BEN:
Somethin' like that, yeah.^

TOM:
(Not knowing whose side to take) All right ... why don't we settle ... .^

HARRY:
Look, mister ... all right ... we came up, okay? We're here. Now I suggest we all go back downstairs before any of these things find out we're in here.^

BEN:
They can't get in here.^

TOM:
You got the whole place boarded up?^

BEN:
(softer) Most of it. all but upstairs  It's weak in places, but it won't be hard to fix it up good^

HARRY:
You're insane. The cellar is the safest place in the house.^

BEN:
(Lashes out) I'm tellin' you they can't get in here!^

HARRY:
And I'm tellin you ... those things turned over our car. We were damned lucky to get away at all. Now you tell me they can't get through a pile of wood.^

TOM:
His wife and kid's downstairs. The kid's pretty badly tore up.^

DIRECTION:
This statement takes the truck-driver completely by surprise. His face softens, he exhales a deep breath. Nobody says anything for a long moment. Finally, the truck-driver swallows and makes his point again ...^

BEN:
Well, I ... I think we're better off up here.^

TOM:
(Glancing about at the barricades) We could strengthen all these up, Mr. Tinsdale.^

BEN:
Man, with all us workin' we could fix this up so nothin' can get in here ... and we got food ... the fire ... and we got the radio.^

HARRY:
We can bring all those things downstairs with us. Man, you're crazy you got a million windows up here ... All these windows, you're gonna make strong enough to keep them out?^

BEN:
Them things ain't got no strength, man, I smashed three of 'em pushed another one out the door.^

HARRY:
I'm telling you they turned our car onto it's roof.^

BEN:
Oh, hell, any good five men can do that.^

HARRY:
That's my point! ... only there's not going to be five ... . there's not going to be ten twenty ... thirty ... a hundred. Maybe ... you know? Once they know we're in here, the place'll be crawlin' with 'em.^

BEN:
Well, if there's that many, there gonna get us wherever we are^

HARRY:
Look, in the cellar, there's only one door, all right? Only one. that's the only place we have to protect. And Tom and I fixed it so it locks and boards from the inside. but all these doors and windows ... . Why, we'd never know where they were going to hit us next.^

BEN:
You got a point, Mr. Tinsdale, but down in the cellar there's no place to run ... I mean, if they do get in, there's no back exit. We'd be done for.^

TOM:
We could get out of here if we had to ... and we can see what's goin' on outside ... Down there, there ain't any windows.. If a rescue party does come we'd never know it ... windows ...^

HARRY:
But the cellar is the strongest place!^

BEN:
The upstairs is just as much of a trap as the cellar ... There's three rooms up there, and they have to be boarded up like this stuff down here ... I got this gun now, we might have to try and get out of here ourselves, 'cause there ain't no guarantee that anybody is gonna send help ... Suppose them things come in here ... We can't bust outta the cellar, cause we open that one door and they got us^

TOM:
I don't know. I think he's right. (he turns to the truck-driver) You know how many's out there?^

BEN:
I figure maybe six, seven.^

HARRY:
Look, you two can do whatever you like. I'm going back down to the cellar, and you better decide, because I'm gonna board up that door and I'm not gonna be crazy enough to unlock it again, no matter what happens.^

TOM:
Wait a minute, Mr. Tinsdale, let's think about this for awhile^

HARRY:
Nope. I've made my decision. You make yours. And you can stew in your own juice.^

TOM:
(Flashing anger) Now wait a minute dammit let's think about this awhile ... We can make it into the cellar if we have to ... and if we do decide to stay down there, we will need some things from up here ... Now let's at least consider this awhile^

BEN:
Man, if you box yourself into that cellar, and if there is a lot of them things that get into the house, you had it. At least up here you can outrun the things.^

TOM:
Yeah, looks like six ... or about ... eight^

More zombies try to reach through the barricade. Tom immediately rushes to help Ben. Zombies end when the music ends^

TOM:

BEN:
Damn ... damn thing from hell ...^

HELEN:
(From the cellar) Harry ... . Harry! ... .^

BEN:
We gotta fix these boards.^

HARRY:
You're crazy ... those things are gonna be at every door and window in the place. We've got to get into the cellar.^

BEN:
Go ahead into your damn cellar! Get outta here!^

HARRY:
I'm taking the girl with me.^

BEN:
You keep your hands off of her, she's stayin' here with me. And you don't touch none of that food. Now if I stay up here I'm gonna be fightin' for what's up here And that food and that radio and all this is what I'm fightin' for. And you are stone dead wrong ... you're just wrong, you understand ... Now, if you're makin' it to the cellar get your ass movin' ... go down these stairs ... . and get out of here, man ... and ... and ... don't mess with me no more ... .^

HARRY:
The man is crazy ... he's crazy ... We've got to have food down there ... we have a right ...^

BEN:
This is your house?^

HARRY:
We've go a right to..^

BEN:
You goin' down there with him?^

TOM:
... Well ...^

BEN:
No beatin' around the bush you goin' or ain't you? This is your last chance.^

TOM:
Harry ... . I think he's right.^

HARRY:
You're crazy.^

TOM:
I really think we're better off up here.^

HARRY:
You're crazy. I got a kid down there. She can't take all the racket, and those things reaching through the glass. We'll be lucky if she lives as it is now.^

BEN:
Okay. Now you're her father. If you're dumb enough to go die in that trap, it's your business. But I ain't dumb enough to go with you. Now get the hell down the cellar ... you can be boss down there ... and I'm boss up here ... and you ain't takin' nothin'.^

TOM:
Harry ... we can get food to you ... if you want to stay down there ... and^

HARRY:
You bastards!^

HARRY:
You know I won't open the door again. I mean it.^

TOM:
We can fix this up here. With your help, we could^

HARRY:
Yeah ... . well I think you're both nuts ... with my help!^

BEN:
(To Tom) Let him go, man, his mind is made up, now let him go.^

HARRY:
(Harry looks for a moment, then lunges for the cellar door, runs through stage right ... stomps feet as if going down the steps ... )^

TOM:
(Rushes to the door) Harry, we'd be better off up here!^

TOM:
(Shouting through the door) Harry, if we stick together, man, we can fix it up real good   There are places we can run to up here^

TOM:
Harry ... we'd be better off if all three of us was workin' together ...^

TOM:

There's two more people upstairs.^

HELEN:
Two?^

HARRY:
Yeah ... I wasn't about to take any unnecessary chances.^

DIRECTION:
Helen is silent.^

HARRY:
How did we know what was going on up there?^

DIRECTION:
Harry checks empty pack of cigarettes.^

HARRY:
Does she seem to be all right?^

DIRECTION:
Helen is silent.^

HARRY:
They're all staying upstairs ... . Idiots! We should stick together ... it's safest down here ... ..^

DIRECTION:
Harry pulls cigarette package from purse.^

HARRY:
They don't stand a chance up there ... . they can't hold those things off forever ... There's too many ways they can get into the house up there^

DIRECTION:
Harry scoops up transistor radio^

HARRY:
They had a radio on upstairs must've been civil defense or  I think it's not just us, this thing is happening all over.^

Harry^

he goes near the walls and stairs, holding it high and spinning the dial.^

HELEN:
Harry ... that thing can't pick up anything in this stinking dungeon!^

DIRECTION:
Harry puts radio back on table.^

HARRY:
So, I hate you ... right? So, I hate the kid? So, I wanna see you die here, right? In this stinking place. My god, Helen, do you realize what's happening? Those things are all over the place ... they'll kill us all ... I enjoy watching my kid suffer like this? I enjoy seeing all this happen?^

DIRECTION:
Helen's head jerks toward him. She looks at him with what is almost vengeance.^

HELEN:
She needs help ... she needs a doctor ... she she might die here ...^

HARRY:
Oh, yeah ... let's just walk out. We can pack up right now and get ready to go, and i'll just say to those things, `Excuse me.. My wife and kid are uncomfortable here ... we're going into town.' For god's sake ... there's maybe twenty of those things out there. and there's more every minute ... .^

HELEN:
There's people upstairs. We should stick together you said. Are we fighting with them? Upstairs, downstairs ... what's the difference? Maybe they can help us. let's get out of here ... . let's go upstairs ...^

DIRECTION:
A pounding sound interrupts her. They listen. The sound is coming from the door, at the top of the stairs.^

TOM:
HARRY!^

DIRECTION:
(From outside the door) More pounding. Harry just stares up at the door, and does not answer the call. Tears well in Helen's eyes. More pounding. Helen looks at Harry. When he does not respond, she gets up and goes for the stairs.^

HELEN:
Yes ... yes, Tom!^

DIRECTION:
Harry, running after her, grabs her shoulders from behind and stops her.^

HELEN:
Harry ... Harry ... it's Tom Ryan.^

TOM:
(Through the door) Harry ... we got food, and some medicine and things from up here^

DIRECTION:
Harry stares up at the door speechlessly.^

TOM:
There's gonna be a thing on the radio ... in ten minutes, Harry ... a civil defense thing ... . to tell us what to do.^

HELEN:
(Looking up at the door, shouts) WE'RE COMING UP! WE'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE!^

HARRY:
You're out of your mind, Helen. All it takes is a minute   those things get in up there and it's too late to change your mind ... Don't you see that? Can't you see that we're safe as long as we keep that door sealed up?^

HELEN:
I don't give a damn! I don't care, Harry. I want to go upstairs ... see if someone will help us ... maybe Karen will be okay^

DIRECTION:
Harry, his adamancy weakening somewhat, takes a cigarette form his mouth, exhaling the last puff, and drops it to the floor. He rubs it out with his foot. The smoke comes in a long stream through his pursed lips. Startlingly, Tom's voice penetrates again.^

TOM:
Harry! ... . Hey, Harry! ... Ben found a television upstairs! Come on up ... we'll see the civil defense broadcast on tv^

HELEN:
Come on ... let's go up   there'll be something on tv that tells us what to do. you can tell them I wanted to come up ... .^

HARRY:
All right ... this is your decision ... we'll go up ... but don't blame me if we all get killed^

Helen has gone immediately to Barbara, looks down at her sympathetically, brushes back her hair^

HELEN:
Poor thing ... she must have been through a lot.^

DIRECTION:
Harry, during these moments, has been flitting anxiously all over the house ...^

TOM:
I think her brother was killed out there.^

BEN:
Tom ... hey, Tom! Are you gonna give me a hand with this thing?^

DIRECTION:
Tom startles, aware of his procrastination, and bolts to help Ben. Harry, pausing momentarily in his anxiety comes over to where his wife is looking after Barbara.^

HELEN:
Her brother was killed ...^

HARRY:
This place is ridiculous. There's a million weak spots up here.^

HELEN:
I don't care ... there's people up here. why don't you do something to help somebody?^

DIRECTION:
Harry, not really hearing her, is staring once more into the gloom outside.^

HARRY:
I can't see a damn thing out there! there could be fifty million of those things, I can't see a thing that's how much good these windows do us Wake that girl up. if there's going to be a thing on the tube, she might as well know where she stands. i don't wand anybody's life on my hands.^

HELEN:
Harry! ... stop acting like a child!^

BEN:
I don't want to hear anymore from you, mister. if you stay up here, you'll take your orders from me ... and that includes leaving that girl alone. she needs rest ... she's just about out of her head as it is now ... now we're just going to let her sleep it off. and nobody's going to touch her unless i say so^

HELEN:
he said the rescue stations have doctors and medical supplies If we could get there, they could help Karen.^

HARRY:
How're we gonna bust outta here? we got a sick kid, two women one of 'em outta her head and three men. And there's a million of them things outside.^

TOM:
Big Bear should have a checkpoint ... about seventeen miles from here.^

BEN:
You from here ... you know this area?^

TOM:
Yeah ... I was workin' in the cemetery across the road ... I'm the caretaker ... two of them things attacked me and i hightailed it over here ... found everybody wiped out ... not too long after, these other people fought their way in here ... I was scared but I opened the basement door and let them in.^

DIRECTION:
(Unbeknownst to everybody else, Barbara has been sitting up, listening; now she speaks, startling them and gathering their attention. She has come down from her hysteria, but is very weak.)^

BARBARA:
You work in the cemetery? ... My brother is over there.^

HELEN:
We have to get to a rescue station ...we have to try and escape.^

HARRY:
Well, I think we ought to stick right here ... and wait for a rescue party. He said if you're few against many you don't have a chance ... We can't tramp seventeen miles through those things ... .^

BEN:
We ain't got to tramp. My truck's right outside the door.^

DIRECTION:
This stops Harry. There is a moment of silence.^

BEN:
But i'm just about out of gas ... There's a pump near the shed outside, but it's locked.^

TOM:
(Becoming more enthused,seeing possibilities) The key ought to be around somewhere ... . there's a big keyring in the basement ... .^

HARRY:
I'm gonna go look ... the keys are labeled (He bolts for the cellar)^

BEN:
Is there a fruit-cellar?^

HARRY:
Yeah ... why?^

BEN:
We're gonna need lots of jars We can make molotov cocktails   scare those things back ... then fight our way to the pump and gas up the truck.^

TOM:
We're gonna need kerosene. There's a jug of that in the basement too.^

HELEN:
Barbara and i can help. We can rip up sheets and things.^

HARRY:
Here's the key-ring. The pump key is marked with a piece of tape.^

BEN:
Good ... that settles that question ... but we should take a crowbar anyway ... in case the key doesn't work. The crowbar can double as a weapon for whoever goes with me. But I don't want to get all the way out there and find out the pump won't open ... .^

TOM:
I'll go ... you and me can fight our way to the pump ... The women can stay in the cellar and take care of the kid. We should have a stretcher ... . Barbara and Helen can do that^

BEN:
Harry, you're gonna have to guard the upstairs. Once we unboard the door, those things can get in here easy. But me and tom have to get in, too, after we get back here with the truck. You've got to guard the door, and unlock it for us. Then we'll board it up as fast as we can, 'cause those things are gonna come fast on our heels If we don't get back, well then you'll be able to see from upstairs, and you can barricade the door again and go to the basement ... You can sit down there and wait for a rescue party.^

HARRY:
I want the gun, then. it's the best thing for me to use. You're not going to have time to stop and aim.^

BEN:
I'm keeping this gun ... nobody else lays a hand on it ...^

HARRY:
You don't care what happens to us ... . How do we know you and Tom won't just take the truck and cut out?^

BEN:
That's the chance you have to take. If we cut out, you'll have your goddamn basement. Like you've been crying about all along.^

HELEN:
We're going to die here ... if we don't all work together.^

BARBARA:
My brother's out there ... maybe we can get him and bring him back. He's just wounded he'll be okay^

HELEN:
(Understanding) That's okay, honey ... . we'll be all right ... maybe your brother will be, too^

BEN:
Let's get busy. we've got a lot to do, if we're gonna bust out of here.^

Soon as the door's unbarred, you can throw those things all over the place ...
